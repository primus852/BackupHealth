BackupHealth v0.1
=================

BackupHealth lets you monitor and backup your projects with ease.
Coming from a heavy `Symfony` background this is my first side-project without any framework involved.

**v0.1**

PoC for the project. Let's see where this is going.

**Install**

- Clone the repo
- run `composer update`
- run `npm install`
- Create Database with `setup/setup.sql`
- Profit

**ToDo / Wishlist**

- ~~check db connection after (before?) adding it~~
- make MySQL entries editable
- ~~add a `ping` Test~~
- (Customizable) MySQL Benchmark Tests
- Backup MySQL
- Backup (S)FTP folders
- entries editable/deletable immediately after adding

**Bugs**

- Adding an item to a table is sometimes not in correct order...
